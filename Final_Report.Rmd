# Motivation

In the era of information overload, pushing to users information matching their preference has been a valuable application and a major challenge in the field of data science. In this project, we proposed to explore the [movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) dataset, a dataset consisting of usersâ€™ rating and tagging towards movies, and implement a demo movie recommendation system.
