## Motivation

In the era of information overload, pushing to users information matching their preference has been a valuable application and a major challenge in the field of data science. In this project, we proposed to explore the movielens dataset, a dataset consisting of usersâ€™ rating and tagging towards movies, and implement a demo movie recommendation system.

## Intended final products

- A report summarizing exploratory analysis results, recommendation algorithms used and predicted user-movie rating

- A shiny app or dashboard giving movie recommendation


## Anticipated data sources

- [MoiveLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/)

- Movie information scraped from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)


## The planned analyses/ visualizations / coding challenges

### Planned analyses

- Find popular movies and high-rating movies

- Investigate the relationship among ratings and various factors, including movie genre, release year, rating time.

- Test the average ratings of the users, to investigate whether the rating criteria are different.(ANOVA)

- Construct a linear model to predict the underlying rating of a specific user. Preference on specific genre. Whether there is a difference between genre and ratings.

### Visualizations:

- Boxplot regarding the rating and years; boxplot regarding the genre and ratings; maybe a linear regression graph to show a specific userâ€™s rating on genre

### Coding challenges:

- Select proper loss function and decompose the user-movie rating matrix through gradient descent

- Scrape basic movie information (length, director, actor, date...) from imdb for calculating movie-movie similarity

- Calculate movie-movie similarity based on movie description and user-generated tags

- Build models to calculate user-similarity


### The planned timeline


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tibble(Date = c("Nov 4", "Nov 9", "Nov 13", "Nov 15", "Nov 16 - 19", "Nov 30", "Dec 7", "Dec 11", "Dec 14", "Dec 16"),
       Task = c("Brainstorm", 
                "Finish draft proposal", 
                "Submit formal proposal",
                "Assign tasks",
                "Project review meeting",
                "Finish coding part",
