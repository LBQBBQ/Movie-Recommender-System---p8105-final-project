# The tentative project title

Recommend movies for users

# The motivation for this project

We proposed to explore a dataset of users’ rating and tagging towards movies and implement a demo movie recommendation system.

# The intended final products

## Models

- Item-similarity based recommendation

- User-similarity based recommendation

- Collaborative filtering (Latent factor model (SVD)) based recommendation

## A shiny app 

- Recommends user movie after the user types his favorite 3 movies

# The anticipated data sources

Dataset from MoiveLens, the link is: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/

# The planned analyses/ visualizations / coding challenges

## Planned analyses:

- Which movies have the highest ratings? Are there any significant differences in the scores of different categories of films? Is there any relationship between the film score and the year of film release? Is there any relationship between film rating and comment time?

- Test the average ratings of the users, to investigate whether the rating criteria are different.(ANOVA)

- Average ratings over years – to investigate whether ratings are different because of the year the movie displayed. 

- Construct a linear model to predict the underlying rating of a specific user. Preference on specific genre. Whether there is a difference between genre and ratings.

## Visualizations:

- Boxplot regarding the rating and years; boxplot regarding the genre and ratings; maybe a linear regression graph to show a specific user’s rating on genre

## Coding challenges:

- To acheive collaborative filtering (Latent factor model (SVD)) based recommendation, we may construct a M*N matrix to calculate the item-similarity and the user-similarity. We may also pick up the most frequent tags from the movie and used the tag to recommend the similar movies.

- SVD
